## About
*National Parks Bucket List* is an app using [NPS Data API](https://www.nps.gov/subjects/developer/index.htm). This app allows user to explore all National Parks in US, mark them as visited, add them to personal bucket list, create text notes, see location on a map. This app doesn't try to solve any existing issue, it just had a simple purpose - inspire user for a next roadtrip and focus on clean UI.
